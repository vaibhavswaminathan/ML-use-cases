Mini-projects that use machine learning
## Project Descriptions
### Times Internet - Multilabel Classification<br>
News reporting in Indian newspapers has unique data traits such as high usage of acronyms, high occurence of proper nouns (eg: celebrity, politician, organisation names). This creates challenges such as correctly associating a name to a news category.

**Techniques/Libraries used:** Word2Vec, FastText, tSNE, LDA, tf-IDF scores

### Visual Data Analysis - UCI forest fires<br>
Forest fires occur due to both natural and anthropogenic causes. A diverse range of environmental factors can create conditions for a forest fire (rain, relative humidity, surface temperature).
Is it possible to draw a relation between the burn area of a forest fire and the prevailing environmental conditions before its occurence? Also, do these non-linear factors have a correlation or pattern that can 
be observed using dimensionality reduction methods?

**Techniques/Libraries used:** Regression(linear, logistic), PCA, Parallel Co-ordinates
